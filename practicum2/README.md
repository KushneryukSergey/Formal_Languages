# Earley algorithm implementation
Implementation of algorithm which checks whether word belong to given
context-free language (hereinafter CFL), which is specified by 
context-free grammar (hereinafter CFG), which means, by its rules

#### [CFL on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_language)

#### [Earley's algorithm on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser)

## How to run:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run this command in terminal in **Practicum2** directory
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```
If you want to check tests coverage use `make testing` in **build** and check **coverage report** folder

All the information, how to input CFG (particularly its rules) will be written by program

Enjoy
