#Automata
This code works under the assumption that we interested in NFA and DFA with number of states less then 60. I do not intent to do code for other cases

##How to run:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run this command in terminal in automata directory
g++ -lm -O2 -fno-stack-limit -std=c++1z -x c++ main.cpp -o solution && ./solution
3. All the information, how to input info about state, transitions etc. will be written by program
4. Enjoy


##Supported features
 * Input and determinize automata
