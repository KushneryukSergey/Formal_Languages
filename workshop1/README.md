# Workshop 1

This code uses lightweight and reformatted version of automata library (without
determinization, minimization and tex-printings), that will be updated soon

## How to run:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run this command in terminal in **automata** directory
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```
If you want to check tests coverage use `make testing` in **build** and check **coverage report** folder

All the information, how to input info about state, transitions etc. will be written by program

Enjoy


## Supported features
 * Input and determinize automata
 * Printing minimization log
 * Printing LaTeX code for tklz library to make automaton graph and table of transitions automaton

> #### See future updates!
